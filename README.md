# Devil's dictionary
LaTeX/PERL formatted text of Ambrose Bierce's "Devil's dictionary"

## Why and how
This was taken from project Gutenberg, then transformed via Perl and LaTeX into
nicely formatted form. In ~2000s.

I enjoyed writing the scripts.

I enjoyed the book.

Originally it was published in colums of newspapers, see [Wikipedia documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_dictionary)

## Necessary addition TODO

**Adulting**:

* the process of finding out how much shit you don't know and have to wing it
* finding out how much *winging it* your "friends" do, how much because they try to explain things, but are also winging it and how much of it is manipulation, boasting
* adjusting weights of all of the above
* finding out who your real friends are (if there's >= 2 left, you are a winner, even a single one is still winner)
* generally finding out everything's fucked up
* but you can fix some things to make it beter
* there are people who will oppose, dispose/workaround without getting thrown in jail/prison
* there's trivial solution, kill everyone, therefore there is empty set of people having problems => all problems solved (you will find a lot of opposition to this,
  even if you try remove just  yourself from the quagmire)
* exit before life fucks you up permanently via some uncurable disease, find out which methods are least possible to leave you crippled (there exist basically binary-result methods - nothing bad happened **xor** everything ended)
